/// referentially stable. A freshly parsed IPC payload otherwise hands every row
/// a NEW object identity on every poll, so the whole feed (up to ~1.4k rows at
/// the per-lane caps, each with several helper calls) re-evaluates even though
/// only the newest entry actually changed. That full-table churn is what shows
/// up as hover lag once a second agent tab is filling the feed.
